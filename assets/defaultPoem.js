        "content": "All my life I had loved music, and rapturous harmonies thrilled my soul,\r\nAs the sound of a wild driving beat, causes eager feet to take control.\r\n\r\nAs a longtime concert pianist, I'd been fortunate to follow my passion,\r\nLike the flower dance of pure sunshine, that never goes out of fashion!\r\n\r\nI not only played at performances, but I frequently played just for fun,\r\nAs the brilliant rainbow laughs at the storm, just as he's come undone.\r\n\r\nMy heart was in beautiful music, and the beautiful music was in my heart,\r\nLike the two who have become wedded, with promises they will never part!\r\n\r\nFamily and friends loved to hear me play, which I did for them ofttimes,\r\nAs the sheer joys of a single afternoon, could be spread over lifetimes.\r\n\r\nI had traveled all over the world, and played in many cities and towns,\r\nJust as the dutiful midnight watchman, is listening for unusual sounds!\r\n\r\nOne sun kissed Saturday I packed a lunch, and left for a secluded beach,\r\nFor when the summertime gets too hot, cool waters are forever in reach.\r\n\r\nI swam and I read and then had lunch, as a youthful afternoon was born,\r\nLike the momentous golden hour, that magenta butterflies become airborne!\r\n\r\nIn summer heat my eyelids grew heavy, as birds sang in bordering trees,\r\nLike night falls in heavy velvetiness, bringing cherry sun to his knees.\r\n\r\nMy slumber was gentle and dreamless, as the sound of the waves rocked me,\r\nAnd I awoke refreshed and happy, for random sea spray had cooled my body.\r\n\r\nWhen I roused at last, I noticed green trees, at the small beach's edge,\r\nAnd I saw bright orange birds singing, on a low branch, by a tall hedge.\r\n\r\nA male bird sang to his ladylove, although she did not appear interested,\r\nSo the male ceased his diligent singing, and preened his feathers instead!\r\n\r\nAt this point I could not look away, for the love scene had intrigued me,\r\nLike being hypnotized by creamy butterflies, in summer's fields of glory.\r\n\r\nThe male bird resumed his singing, hopping and preening between the notes,\r\nAnd golden sunbeams cascaded, amidst gentle waves and sound of speedboats.\r\n\r\nThe female looked more interested, although trying to appear unaffected,\r\nLike dying winter when losing its cool, tries doggedly to seem collected!\r\n\r\nThen suddenly from stage left, another orange male flitted onto the scene,\r\nAnd began enacting his own courtship, rivalling stars of the movie screen!\r\n\r\nHis soliloquy of song was so lovely, that I sat there rapt and delighted,\r\nAnd the female's demeanor was cool, so none could tell what she'd decided.\r\n\r\nSuddenly the first male attacked, in an orange blaze of beak and feathers,\r\nSort of like the views you'd get, in an abrupt change to stormy weather!\r\n\r\nThe second male flew rapidly away, in a flurry of wounded dignity and pride,\r\nLike fireflies when noonday sun is out, necessitating a cool place to hide.\r\n\r\nAfter the unglamorous exit at stage right, the suave courtship was resumed,\r\nAnd the female was finally responding, to the virtuoso singer richly plumed!\r\n\r\nSoon it was obvious they were a pair, and a burnished day was growing old,\r\nNight's curtains soon would be falling, like shooting stars, uncontrolled.\r\n\r\nBetween that day's pink sunrise east, to its vibrantly orange sunset west,\r\nI discovered sometimes love is only returned, after being put to the test!",

        "content": "When dark December glooms the day,\nAnd takes our autumn joys away;\nWhen short and scant the sunbeam throws,\nUpon the weary waste of snows,\nA cold and profitless regard,\nLike patron on a needy bard,\nWhen silvan occupation's done,\nAnd o'er the chimney rests the gun,\nAnd hang, in idle trophy, near,\nThe game-pouch, fishing-rod, and spear;\nWhen wiry terrier, rough and grim,\nAnd greyhound, with his length of limb,\nAnd pointer, now employed no more,\nCumber our parlour's narrow floor;\nWhen in his stall the impatient steed\nIs long condemned to rest and feed;\nWhen from our snow-encircled home,\nScarce cares the hardiest step to roam,\nSince path is none, save that to bring\nThe needful water from the spring;\nWhen wrinkled news-page, thrice conned o'er,\nBeguiles the dreary hour no more,\nAnd darkling politican, crossed\nInveighs against the lingering post,\nAnd answering housewife sore complains\nOf carriers' snow-impeded wains;\nWhen such the country cheer, I come,\nWell pleased, to seek our city home;\nFor converse, and for books, to change\nThe Forest's melancholy range,\nAnd welcome, with renewed delight,\nThe busy day and social night.\nNot here need my desponding rhyme\nLament the ravages of time,\nAs erst by Newark's riven towers,\nAnd Ettrick stripped of forest bowers.\nTrue-Caledonia's Queen is changed,\nSince on her dusky summit ranged,\nWithin its steepy limits pent,\nBy bulwark, line, and battlement,\nAnd flanking towers, and laky flood,\nGuarded and garrisoned she stood,\nDenying entrance or resort,\nSave at each tall embattled port;\nAbove whose arch, suspended, hung\nPortcullis spiked with iron prong.\nThat long is gone,-but not so long,\nSince, early closed, and opening late,\nJealous revolved the studded gate,\nWhose task, from eve to morning tide,\nA wicket churlishly supplied.\nStern then, and steel-girt was thy brow,\nDunedin! Oh, how altered now,\nWhen safe amid thy mountain court\nThou sitt'st, like empress at her sport,\nAnd liberal, unconfined, and free,\nFlinging thy white arms to the sea,\nFor thy dark cloud, with umbered lower,\nThat hung o'er cliff, and lake, and tower,\nThou gleam'st against the western ray\nTen thousand lines of brighter day.\nNot she, the championess of old,\nIn Spenser's magic tale enrolled,\nShe for the charmed spear renowned,\nWhich forced each knight to kiss the ground -\nNot she more changed, when, placed at rest,\nWhat time she was Malbecco's guest,\nShe gave to flow her maiden vest;\nWhen from the corslet's grasp relieved,\nFree to the sight her bosom heaved;\nSweet was her blue eye's modest smile,\nErst hidden by the aventayle;\nAnd down her shoulders graceful rolled\nHer locks profuse, of paly gold.\nThey who whilom, in midnight fight,\nHad marvelled at her matchless might,\nNo less her maiden charms approved,\nBut looking liked, and liking loved.\nThe sight could jealous pangs beguile,\nAnd charm Malbecco's cares a while;\nAnd he, the wandering squire of dames,\nForgot his Columbella's claims,\nAnd passion, erst unknown, could gain\nThe breast of blunt Sir Satyrane;\nNor durst light Paridel advance,\nBold as he was, a looser glance.\nShe charmed at once, and tamed the heart,\nIncomparable Britomarte!\nSo thou, fair city! disarrayed\nOf battled wall, and rampart's aid,\nAs stately seem'st, but lovelier far\nThan in that panoply of war.\nNor deem that from thy fenceless throne\nStrength and security are flown;\nStill as of yore Queen of the North!\nStill canst thou send thy children forth.\nNe'er readier at alarm-bell's call\nThy burghers rose to man thy wall,\nThan now, in danger, shall be thine,\nThy dauntless voluntary line;\nFor fosse and turret proud to stand,\nTheir breasts the bulwarks of the land.\nThy thousands, trained to martial toil,\nFull red would stain their native soil,\nEre from thy mural crown there fell\nThe slightest knosp or pinnacle.\nAnd if it come-as come it may,\nDunedin! that eventful day -\nRenowned for hospitable deed,\nThat virtue much with Heaven may plead\nIn patriarchal times whose care\nDescending angels deigned to share;\nThat claim may wrestle blessings down\nOn those who fight for the good town,\nDestined in every age to be\nRefuge of injured royalty;\nSince first, when conquering York arose,\nTo Henry meek she gave repose,\nTill late, with wonder, grief, and awe,\nGreat Bourbon's relics, sad she saw.\nTruce to these thoughts!-for, as they rise,\nHow gladly I avert mine eyes,\nBodings, or true or false, to change,\nFor Fiction's fair romantic range,\nOr for tradition's dubious light,\nThat hovers 'twixt the day and night:\nDazzling alternately and dim,\nHer wavering lamp I'd rather trim,\nKnights, squires, and lovely dames, to see\nCreation of my fantasy,\nThan gaze abroad on reeky fen,\nAnd make of mists invading men.\nWho love not more the night of June\nThan dull December's gloomy noon?\nThe moonlight than the fog of frost?\nAnd can we say which cheats the most?\nBut who shall teach my harp to gain\nA sound of the romantic strain,\nWhose Anglo-Norman tones whilere\nCould win the royal Henry's ear,\nFamed Beauclerc called, for that he loved\nThe minstrel, and his lay approved?\nWho shall these lingering notes redeem,\nDecaying on Oblivion's stream;\nSuch notes as from the Breton tongue\nMarie translated, Blondel sung?\nO! born Time's ravage to repair,\nAnd make the dying muse thy care;\nWho, when his scythe her hoary foe\nWas poising for the final blow,\nThe weapon from his hand could wring,\nAnd break his glass, and shear his wing,\nAnd bid, reviving in his strain,\nThe gentle poet live again;\nThou, who canst give to lightest lay\nAn unpedantic moral gay,\nNor less the dullest theme bid flit\nOn wings of unexpected wit;\nIn letters as in life approved,\nExample honoured and beloved -\nDear Ellis! to the bard impart\nA lesson of thy magic art,\nTo win at once the head and heart -\nAt once to charm, instruct, and mend,\nMy guide, my pattern, and my friend!\nSuch minstrel lesson to bestow\nBe long thy pleasing task-but, oh!\nNo more by thy example teach -\nWhat few can practise, all can preach -\nWith even patience to endure\nLingering disease, and painful cure,\nAnd boast affliction's pangs subdued\nBy mild and manly fortitude.\nEnough, the lesson has been given:\nForbid the repetition, Heaven!\nCome, listen, then! for thou hast known,\nAnd loved the minstrel's varying tone,\nWho, like his Border sires of old,\nWaked a wild measure rude and bold,\nTill Windsor's oaks, and Ascot plain,\nWith wonder heard the Northern strain.\nCome, listen! bold in thy applause,\nThe bard shall scorn pedantic laws;\nAnd, as the ancient art could stain\nAchievements on the storied pane,\nIrregularly traced and planned,\nBut yet so glowing and so grand -\nSo shall he strive in changeful hue,\nField, feast, and combat to renew,\nAnd loves, and arms, and harpers' glee,\nAnd all the pomp of chivalry.",
